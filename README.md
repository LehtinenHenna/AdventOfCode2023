# Advent of code 2023

In this repository you can find my puzzle solutions for the advent of code event of 2023.

The event can be found here: [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com)

I've divided the puzzle of each day into a separate folder. The puzzle of each day has two parts, but I've solved both parts in the same piece of code. In the folder of each day, you can find the day[number].py, which is the puzzle solution code. Each file also has an assignment[number].md, which contains the part 1 and part 2 puzzle descriptions. You might also find a test-input.txt that I've used to try out the code.

There's also a [utils](utils) folder, int which util.py contains some helper functions that I've used for solving the puzzles.
